# Python MAC Changer
A python mac address changer made using pycharm, this is mainly a test project used to get used to the subprocess modules and basic python scripts. There are most likely errors and cleanup possible in this program due to me having very limitted experience with Python and Git.

## Requirements
  - Python 2 or 3 depending on which script you want to use
  - Linux system. This system was designed on and built for Kali Linux but should work with any system that can use the ifconfig commands
